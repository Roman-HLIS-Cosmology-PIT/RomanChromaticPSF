The full Diffsky extragalactic catalog and stellar catalog are available through the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) at https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/theory/openuniverse2024/overview.html. The cosmoDC2 catalog is available  through NERSC at https://portal.nersc.gov/project/lsst/cosmoDC2/_README.html. The Diffsky catalog is discussed in: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05632. The cosmoDC2 catalog is discussed in: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab510c.
