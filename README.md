# Chromatic Effects on PSF and Shear Measurement for Roman

## Introduction

The software and data used are based on the paper:
 - Chromatic Effects on the PSF and Shear Measurement for the Roman Space Telescope High-Latitude Wide Area Survey; Berlfein et al. (2025), submitted - [ADS entry](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250500093B/abstract)


This repository includes software to:
 - Generate Roman-like image simulations of the [OpenUniverse2024 catalog](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/data/theory/openuniverse2024/overview.html) or the [cosmoDC2 catalog](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/lsst/cosmoDC2/_README.html) using [GalSim](https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim).
 - Generate catalog-level magnitude noise using [PhotErr](https://github.com/jfcrenshaw/photerr).
 - Perform shear measurement on galaxy images using [AnaCal](https://github.com/mr-superonion/AnaCal).
 - Correct for SED-dependant chromatic effects on the PSF.

Note that in order to generate the actual image simulations, the relevant extragalactic and stellar catalogs are not provided here and must be downloaded. We provide catalog-level magnitudes (both true and observed), along with their errors, for the Roman (YJHFW) and LSST (ugrizy) bands. All entries contain object IDs in case you wish to cross-match with the full simulated catalogs. 


## Installation

You can clone the repository using:
```
git clone https://github.com/FedericoBerlfein/RomanChromaticPSF.git
```


## Guide to repository contents
Below is an overview on the contents of this repository. More details on each folder can be found in each folders respective README. 

- ``Gal_props_catnoise``: This folder contains the catalog-level noisy and true magnitudes, magnitude errors, object IDs, and redshift, for every object used in the paper. More details on the contents of this folder can be found in it's respective README.
- ``PaperFigures``: All the figures used in the paper.
- ``SED_fit_coeff``: The scripts used to fit the SEDs, as well as the results of the fits.
- ``gen_sims``: The scripts used to generate the image simulations and do the shape measurement.
- ``notebooks``: Some of the notebooks needed to either generate some of the intermediate data, analyze results, and plot relevant figures.
- ``shear_measurement_cosmoDC2/diffsky``: The measured shapes from the image simulations for different PSFs or correction schemes.
- ``sim_images``: Empty directory given that simulated images are too heavy to upload to Github.  Nevertheless, this is where there simulated images would live after running relevant scripts in ``gen_sims``.
